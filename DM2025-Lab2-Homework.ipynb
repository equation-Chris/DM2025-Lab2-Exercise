        "\n",
        "**Syntax:** `###` creates a tertiary heading (H3).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data sources**\n",

        "- `samplesubmission.csv`: template file with the exact `id` ordering required by Kaggle.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Flatten the JSON posts**  \n",
        "   I used `pandas.json_normalize` on `final_posts.json` and extracted the two useful columns:\n",
        "   - `root._source.post.post_id` → renamed to `id`\n",
        "   - `root._source.post.text` → renamed to `text`  \n",
        "   This gave me a flat DataFrame where each row is one tweet with its textual content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Merge metadata and labels**  \n",
        "   - First, I merged the posts DataFrame with `data_identification.csv` on the `id` column to add the `split` information.  \n",
        "   - Then, for rows with `split == \"train\"`, I merged with `emotion.csv` to attach the `emotion` label to each training tweet.  \n",
        "   - Rows with `split == \"test\"` were kept as the unlabeled test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Align test order with the submission file**  \n",
        "   Kaggle expects the predictions to follow exactly the order in `samplesubmission.csv`.  \n",
        "   To guarantee this, I re-merged the test posts with `samplesubmission.csv` on `id`.  \n",
        "   This step ensures that `submission_roberta_simple.csv` has the same row order as the competition’s template.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Basic cleaning / type handling**  \n",
        "   I did not perform heavy text cleaning such as removing punctuation or lower-casing manually, because the RoBERTa tokenizer expects fairly raw text.  \n",
        "   I only made sure that the `text` column is of string type before sending it to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result of these steps, I obtained two key tables:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `train_df(id, text, emotion)` for model training.\n",
        "- `test_df(id, text)` for generating Kaggle predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Feature Engineering Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of traditional manual feature engineering (e.g., TF-IDF, bag-of-words, handcrafted lexicon scores), I relied on **label encoding + transformer embeddings**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Label encoding**  \n",
        "   - I collected all unique emotion labels from `train_df[\"emotion\"]`.\n",
        "   - I created a mapping dictionary, e.g. `{\"joy\": 0, \"sadness\": 1, \"anger\": 2, \"fear\": 3, ...}`.\n",
        "   - A new column `labels` was added to the training data by mapping each emotion string to its corresponding integer id.\n",
        "   - An inverse mapping was also stored so that I can convert predictions back from ids to emotion strings when creating the submission.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Train/validation split**  \n",
        "   - The model input for SimpleTransformers is a DataFrame with columns `[\"text\", \"labels\"]`.\n",
        "   - I split this DataFrame into:\n",
        "     - `train_split` (90%) and\n",
        "     - `eval_split` (10%)  \n",
        "     using `train_test_split` with `stratify=train_data[\"labels\"]`.  \n",
        "   - Stratification keeps the label distribution similar in both sets, which makes the validation accuracy more reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Implicit feature engineering by RoBERTa**  \n",
        "   Although I did not manually design numerical features, RoBERTa internally converts each tweet into contextual embeddings that capture:\n",
        "   - word meaning,\n",
        "   - word order,\n",
        "   - long-range dependencies,\n",
        "   - and subtle sentiment / emotion clues.  \n",
        "   This can be regarded as automatically learned feature engineering performed by the transformer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the model learns features directly from raw text, no separate TF-IDF or n-gram matrices were required in this final solution.\n",

        "\n",
        "Before settling on RoBERTa, I experimented with several more traditional approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. TF-IDF + LinearSVC / Logistic Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) Unigram and bigram TF-IDF features with a maximum of 30k–50k features.\n",
        "\n",
        "(2) LinearSVC and Logistic Regression with different C values and with/without class weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "(3) This approach achieved validation accuracies around 0.58–0.62 and Kaggle scores around 0.59.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. TF-IDF + additional handcrafted features\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) I tried adding simple sentiment-lexicon features (counts of positive/negative words, number of exclamation marks, length of the tweet, etc.) by concatenating them to the TF-IDF vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "(2) This gave only very small improvements and made the pipeline more complicated.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Hybrid ensemble (SVM + Logistic Regression + Naive Bayes + Gradient Boosting)\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) I also implemented a more complex ensemble where several linear models and a histogram gradient boosting classifier were combined by soft voting.\n",
        "\n",
        "(2) The ensemble was able to slightly increase the validation macro F1 compared to a single linear model, but still did not reach the performance of RoBERTa.\n",
        "\n",
        "These trials were useful to understand the baseline performance of classical feature-engineering methods and to justify the move to transformer-based models.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Mention Insights You Gained\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Transformers significantly outperform bag-of-words on this task.\n",
        "Even a relatively simple RoBERTa fine-tuning setup already beats well-tuned TF-IDF + SVM models.\n",
        "This shows the advantage of contextual embeddings for subtle emotional cues in short tweets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Preprocessing choices matter less for RoBERTa.\n",
        "With traditional models, I had to carefully decide how to normalize text, remove punctuation, handle emojis, etc.\n",
        "For RoBERTa, keeping the raw text (including capitalization and punctuation) actually worked better, because the tokenizer and pretraining are designed for natural text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Correct data alignment is crucial.\n",
        "Re-ordering the test set according to samplesubmission.csv was a small but important step; without it, the Kaggle score would not reflect the true performance of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Validation strategy provides reliable feedback.\n",
        "Using a stratified 90/10 split for validation helped me quickly compare different ideas without overfitting to the Kaggle public leaderboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this lab taught me how to move from a classical feature-engineering pipeline to a modern transformer-based solution, and how each stage—preprocessing, feature representation, and model design—affects the final leaderboard performance.\n",
